You've felt it your entire life. Know what I'm talking about?

Damn. Today is going to be a busy study day. I have to finish up things on IT6206 Database ER Modelling Assignment, finish IT6206 Marked Lab, IT6213 Audience Analysis Assignment and do some research for IT6205 Project!

I'm starting to feel sorry for myself. Oh why do we have to study for a peice of paper that say we know shit to work? Economy is dumb, waste of time, we should be living life before we die, not working.
