Sad unfortunate incidents out and about Sunday morning.

I refer you to this article.

It is upsetting that even with the good stuff some people have to go that extra bit further to get that lil extra high. Some times you just shouldn't go that hard.

I knew two of the people involved with this incident and it is quite upsetting. I hope that they are alright, tho I think they are I will have to check up on that.

Other than that I had a good time at June's Twisted?.
