Nothing significant happened on the weekend. Hence the lack of photos. I think the camera needed a weekend off anyway. Good that, as it is going to be heavily used on Thursday for Fevah 4th Birthday oh boy I cannot wait.

My Nirvana tshirt I won in auction at Trademe arrived this morning. Neat huh? It's the smiley face one!

Gotta go now so I can get a park outside tech or else I'll be late!
