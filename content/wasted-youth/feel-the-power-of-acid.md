Do you like Eliza Dushku? I certainly do, as you can see I have implemented her in my new design of wASTEDyOUTH.

It has been a while. But I have taken a well deserved break. I have started back at tech for my second year of BIT and am lovin it. I will be able to use this space to log my progress throughout the year as well as post my trials and tribulations.

The site needs tweaking here and there and will be over time. I have coded everything in XHTML and PHP and using GreyMatter to post to the main page.

I would like to hear your comments, so pass me an an email and tell me!
