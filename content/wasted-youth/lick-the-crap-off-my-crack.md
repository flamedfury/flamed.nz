**mood**: Day 61

Where the hell does the time go. It's already December. I turn 19 in like, 2 days 7th December. Yayayya. It's friday morning. I should be sleeping, which is what I am about to do. I will find some time after day job before I go to night job to post. Gearbox should be ready. Paint is like, here, somewhere, waiting for Dan to deliver. I will explain my plan of attack for saturday. Must sleep. night.
