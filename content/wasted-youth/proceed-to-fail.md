**mood**: Day 37 of no Dak

Today was a pretty easy day. Woke up at 9ish got in the shower and shit  got to tech for my 10am lecture. We just went over what will be in the  written assessment next week for IN600. Should pass that one with flying colours.

But tomorrow I have my NM600 written assessment which will be tougher, but I'm fully prepared for it so that should go good.

After tech I just came home read my book and slept. Yay, I love sleep. Then  watched tv, as I currently still am doing. South Park is on in an hour  so I can't wait for that as C4 plays the 7th series. Fuckin crackup if I may add. 

But after my assesment tomorrow it will be a relief as that is one down, then I have to do NM600 practical on Friday at 1pm.  So hopefully it all goes well.

I also start my new job at [Hell Pizza](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.hell.co.nz/) on Thursday, hopefully I won't be there that long as I wanna go see Matrix Revolutions with Josh and that at 9pm. Thursday morning I also  have a job interview at 9am at [Fontera](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.fonterra.co.nz/) on the HelpDesk. If I land this job, then that will be me all summer  saving up for my trip to Brisbane and the Gold Coast in April. 

Sounds good. I have some stuff to tidy up on the website so I'll do that now. Later.
