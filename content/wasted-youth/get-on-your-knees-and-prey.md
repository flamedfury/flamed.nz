I've been gone a while, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Surfers Paradise. Been back 2 weeks but havn't had much time to myself.

Spending lots of my spare time trying to figure out what's happening with myself.

It's all confused at the moment, but I'll get there hopefully.

In the photo album there are photos from my trip to Australia, some didn't upload, I'll see to getting them up as I see the photo I got of Paris Hilton's 'back of her head' isn't up there.

Lots to do so little time to do it, I will get photos from Bedlam up shortly.

Which reminds me, I need to get a new camera as the photo's I'm getting when there's a fog machine involved just suck.
