**mood**: Day 52

Been very busy.

Had an awesome Saturday night Sunday morning. Was hugely awesome. Glad I didn't have to go to Community Work on Sunday. Would of been tough.

I completed my third day at my new job today. Slowly getting the hang of it. Slowly starting to enjoy it. Im just thinking of how I'm gonna be able to afford to get my car up and running again. Yay.

Its really tiring me out though. But I'll get used to it I guess.

Counting the days away to my 19th, which is on 7 December. Gonna rock it out at Phoenix for Twisted which is on Saturday the 6th for my birthday. Lots of fun indeedy.

Gotta gap, gonna go get some sleep or something.
