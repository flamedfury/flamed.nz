**mood**: Day 81

Merry Christmas everyone! Hope Santa was good to you, and I hope he didn't touch you in places he shouldn't! It has been a very busy time for me the past few weeks, but I have some spare time now till Janurary and I'll make the most of it.

I got given a neat digital camera for christmas today so yayayaya! Photos photos and more photos. I'd love to see you try and shake a stick to all the photo's I'm gonna have.

Well I'll get back to it now. Have an excellent Christmas, dont get too drunk!
