**mood**: Day 43

Gutted for the All Blacks. I won't bother linking them as the whole of  New Zealand is pissed at them. Hahaha i wonder if customs will let them  back in the country :)

Oh well on to Tech things. I did my  HelpDesk600 written exam today found it pretty easy after the study that I did beforehand. On a sadder note, I got my HM600 written test results back only achieved 73% so I have to resit that on Wedensday. Tomorrow  morning I have IN600 written test at 10am and then IN600 practical at  11am. Good luck.

Also tomorrow before my exams I will be meeting  my mate and organising some paint for my car, a nice colour that will  look good on my car. Yay can't wait for it to arrive!
