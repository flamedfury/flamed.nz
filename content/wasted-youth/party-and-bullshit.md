**mood**: Day 40

Yesterday went pretty well. I enjoyed my first shift at [Hell](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.hell.co.nz/), I thought that I settled in just right.

I gotta gap off to [Tech](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.weltec.ac.nz/) now and start preparing for my HM600 practical on fault finding. Wish me luck.
