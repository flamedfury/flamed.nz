But not ours! **Rage Winterchill Down** (28/04/2008)

We decided to get straight back into Hyjal after the other nights  close call. We were all stoked that we did. After one failed attempt we  managed to down Winterchill with few casualties. Much cheering ensued.

I walked away with [Bracers of the Pathfinder](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210224/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30864) which were quickly socketed with a [Delicate Living Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210224/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24028) and enchanted with Assault D: [Rejuvenating Bracers](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210224/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30868) also dropped, but we had no resto druids in the raid, so the only druid (feral) got them, no one else seemed interested…

We had quite a few trash drops as well, hearts of darkness etc etc, i forget now, it all goes so fast during the waves.

After we finished celebrating the downing of Winterchill we all  repaired and headed to see Mags. We downed him without much effort at  all. Three more people got T4 chests, a holly pally got the head to  exchange for a ring, and the gems went to the bank, to be auctioned off  tomorrow.

A couple of months ago I didn’t think that achieving 1000+ agility  would be in my grasp, clearly I am getting this whilst raid buffed now.  Lunch is a happy hunter.

There I am in all my raid buffed glory: AotH, Warp Burger, Elixir of  Major Agility, TSA, GotW, Kings, Might, Fort. No feral druid in group  unfortunately, otherwise I imagine my crit would be right up there in  the mid forties.

Unbuffed I sit at 834 Agility, 33.42% Crit, uhm, 2000ish AP. Should be sitting on 900 unbuffed agility any day now.

Larissa of [The Hunter’s Mark](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210224/http://www.thehuntersmark.net/) (great site by the way) is striving for 800 agility at the moment, she  has posts that explain in great detail how she is going to achieve this. She doesn’t have the access to the same content as I currently do, but  that does not seem to be stopping her! She’s currently sitting at 726.  Good luck!

I also am excited about, being 20 badges away from [Leggings of the Pursuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210224/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34914). They will bring me even closer to 900, with the rubies (screw the  socket bonus ><). They will also be a worthy destination for the[Nethercobra Armor](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210224/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29535) I have stashed way D:

**In Conclusion**: We are now 1/6 SSC, 2/4 TKE, 1/5 Hyjal - a bit backwards, yes I know, I will continue our push into SSC!
