**Current Smith Hauthaa Status:** 100%

Khaz opened up Smith Hauthaa some time yesterday afternoon. I was  unable to get on and such until now. I headed straight to Quel’Danas to  see her.

First thing I purchased was a pair of [Gauntlets of Rapidity](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210525/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34916) and quickly enchanted +15 agility. Next was [Angelista’s Revenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210525/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34887) which replaced [Pathfinder’s Band](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210525/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31277).

My stats are really started to balance up now, currently unbuffed 814 agility, 1876 AP (2038 with AotH) and 34.29% crit.

I am left with 42 [Badge of Justice](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210525/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29434)’s now, aiming to get another 60 so that I can get [Leggings of the Pursuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210525/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34914) which will be a damn good successor to the T4 legs!

What gear have you collected so far from Smith Hauthaa so far?
