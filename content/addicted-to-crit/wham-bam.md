**thank you mam**. Murmur is down. Ran with a great group, prot pally, no mucking around. Only heroic Arc to go now! /yawn

**Update**: Have finished heroic Arc numerous times, the healers seem to have trouble keeping Millhouse Manastorm alive ><

I guess that’s fair as none of them have been on the Naruu Trial  quest… But still… Will get back in there with the group from last night  hopefully.
