Due to my PC being out of action for the last week I havn’t been able to get on and play Warcraft.

I must say that I am rather enjoying my time doing other stuff during the week nights.

Doesn’t sound like I am missing out on much mind you, the oceanic  servers are still having big problems during peak raid times.  <strong>No Instance Server Available</strong>.

Anyway…. I’ve decided that I want to acheive / do / complete the following before Wrath drops:

- [Trollbane](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210248/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33492)
- [Ranger-General’s Chestguard](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210248/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30054)
- At least 5/6 SSC 3/4 TKE (if we cannot do a full clear)
- Swift Wintersaber D:
- Paladin to 70
- Decent set of gear ideal for Pally AOE at 70

Not toooo much, I believe I can get my lovely Paladin to 70 no sweat  (so long as I fix up my PC). Gearing her up shouldn’t be too much of a  problem either. I have also had one of our Paladins promise that he will assist in getting her epic charger, very keen for that as I havn’t been to stratholme before (missed the being 60 pre TBC boat).

The axe and chest piece shouldn’t be too difficult. The gear will take the co-operation of 9-24 other people tho.

Have you set yourself any goals to complete before we head to Northerend?

   possibly a good one to get, especially for later on! 

   i wonder if they will add another level of mount training at level 80?
