Last night we ventured into Zul’Aman again - my first time in there since last night I wrote about it I believe.

Due to more people leaving the guild and the [Oceanic PVE to PVP Transfer](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210135/http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/06/12/oceanic-alliance-characters-to-get-free-pve-to-pvp-transfers/) offer Khaz is dealing with changes, in numbers and all that. We  attempted a joint SSC raid on Monday night that went fairly well, but  nothing to write home about. Truthfully, we spent too much time waiting  around organizing everything blah blah blah.

Which is why I have no issues with getting 10 of our more dedicated  people and heading to the Ghostlands for some Troll city exploring with  Harrison Jones! Funny how last night’s run coincided with a recent  Hunter’s Mark Post titled “[Herding Raiders](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210135/http://www.thehuntersmark.net/2008/06/16/herding-raiders/)“. We worked well together, took down Nalorakk within the timer, then  headed off to Akil’zon where we ran into some difficulties where some  freak accident caused two of our DPS die in the first thirty seconds :S  timer failed, no worries. We headed back to Nalorakk’s platform to free  good ol’ Tanzar who gave me a pair of [Shadowhunter’s Treads](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210135/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33805) (will have to slap dexterity on them and try them out).

A five minute break was called, then we carried on to Jan’ala’s  platform with no issues to play with fire. We hatched the eggs, killed  the dragons, stayed out of the fire and took him down. He dropped more  hunter loot [Arrow-fall Chestguard](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210135/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33328), which I also took (building a haste set more on that later).

We mounted up and started clearing towards Halazzi, those crocs that  sometimes decide to join the trash fights are damn annoying, are they  not? As we reached his hut/temple? We suddenly couldn’t move and  noooooo! Server crash! GG.

It was late anyway so I took it as a good night blessing.

Tonight I’m hoping we can gather together again and take down Halazzi and then start having our first serious attempts at Hex Lord. I’m not  really in the mind set of looking forward to 25 Man’s any more. You  could say I have Jungle Troll Fever! If we only do ZA for the next  couple of months I’ll be content and happy.

The place would have to be my favorite BC instance. The fact that it  is a 10 man, we don’t have to scrape the barrel to fill in spots, bring  in our dedicated players without fear of them gearing up and jumping  ship and that we can get everyone ready to go within five minutes really appeals to me.

Next reset tho we’re definitely getting the double timer and we can all /bow down to the glory of [Trollbane](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210135/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33492). Can’t wait.

Ps. My Paladin also got her Charger - Yay for her.
