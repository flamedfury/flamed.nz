![Murmur, the pain](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210024im_/http://critaddict.shadyacres.co.nz/assets/location/murmur_03april08.jpg)

**Warrior**, Boomkin, Rogue, Paladin and myself entered Heroic Shadow Labyrinth last night to try and defeat Murmur so that we could claim [Murmur’s Essence](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31722).

Everything was going well, we managed the five and six pulls before  Blackheart with only one wipe. One sap, one offtank, one trap, and I  kited the other, trapped, then kited the first trapped then feigned so  he went back to the group where they would be waiting.

We had an issue with our tank who suddenly went afk for 30 minutes  before Vorpil, we quickly replaced and took down Vorpil before he could  do anything.

Then we proceeded to wipe for an hour and a half on Murumur. We read  and re-read the advice on wowhead, had guildies hop in our vent channel  to give advice, had group members flatmate come in and watch from his  screen on vent to give advice. We were doing everything how we should  but we kept going down.

By the time all our armor was broken we decided to call it and try again another day…

Do you have any hints or tips for heroic murmur?
