**Thought** that I would get this out there while I  still have a chance, before all the excitement is over. Currently, at  the time of writing this (according to [Gorgonnash](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210546/http://us.gorgonnash.info/index.html)), Khaz’Goroth is 16% done of phase three, and 33% of the way to opening up the badge vendor [Smith Hauthaa](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210546/http://wowhead.com/?npc=25046).

I was out there yesterday afternoon checking out the phase three  quests, and everyone and their alts were out on Greengill Coast killing  Myrmidon’s and looting their keys for the effort of building Hauthaa’s  anvil. Good to see, except when you’re trying to collect the three keys  yourself and can’t due to heavy encampment.

I have saved up enough badges to get me a couple pieces when they  become available (I’m hoping within a week) that will help me fill out  some gear gaps. I will get onto those later as they become available.

So far I have managed to complete all the new dailies, almost daily,  accumulating a massive stockpile of greens that are periodically  disenchanted, and only one badge. Last weekend I was able to complete a  PUG run of Magister’s Terrace on normal and picked up the [Hauberk of the Warbringer](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210546/http://wowhead.com/?item=34799) from Kael. Really want to get back in on Heroic for a chance at [Tunic of the Ranger Lord](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210546/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34614) though, as I will benefit more from the crit than the haste that the  Hauberk gives me. I also wouldn’t mind duel wielding a pair of [Breeching Comet](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210546/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34616)’s either. May take some instancing.

So, how progressed is your server in the fight for the Sunwell, and  what are you looking forward to picking up in your adventures on the  Isle?
