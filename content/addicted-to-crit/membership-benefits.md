>He descends through the clouds of the Nagrand sky, passing  over the wandering herds of the clefthoof. on his way to the Consortium  encampment. He lands in a cloud of dust as he leaps from the back of his mighty Netherdrake companion telling him to rest up quick as they wont  be stopping for long.

>“Lunch my old friend!’ cries Gezhe “I was wondering when you would arrive, you’re not usually this late”

>“I’ve had some business to take care of back in Azeroth” he replies

**Managed** to pick up a [Nobel Topaz](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210155/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23439) and a [Talasite](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210155/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23437) in my latest visit to the Consortium guys in Nagrand. First time that  I’ve received blue gems instead of all greens! Such a pity that upon my  return everyone has started decking themselves out in epic gems! I’m  starting to feel a bit left out, I may have to start investing in a  Bulging Sack of [Crimson Spinel’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014210155/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32194) :grin:
