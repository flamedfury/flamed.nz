**Alert Level**: Four
**Day**: 21

_love me till the day i die_


[The country continues to trend in the right direction](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/414422/covid-19-coronavirus-developments-in-new-zealand-on-16-april). Some people are now complaining of over reaction. I think the only reaction in this case was an over reaction, this is why we're in the position where are in today! We are already making plans for dropping down to level 3! Come on!.

Have been messaging my barber recently as my hair is long. I have the dog clippers available so might be a home cut coming up.

Take care, stay clean.
