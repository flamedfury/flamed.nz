**Alert Level**: Four

**Day**: 14

Yesterday the weather turned a bit grey and windy. Up here it gets quite windy. It was noticeable with this change the lack of many families with dogs walking. 

I quite enjoyed the quiet walks without the many distractions for my boys.

We ventured out this morning for a short walk as it was raining pretty hard. Clearing up now though so hopefully only the dedicated are out again. Will make time after my morning meetings.

The last thing I want is cabin fever poodles. 

Take care.
