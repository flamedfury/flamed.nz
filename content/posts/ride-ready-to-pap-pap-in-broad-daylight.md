**Alert Level**: Four

**Day**: 11

Thank heck it's Friday. I'm settling in for the evening with a couple cans of [Behemoth Brewing](https://behemoth-brewing.myshopify.com/discount/BEH25G22PEC?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fall) thank heck that they're classified as an essential service otherwise I'd be severly out of sorts.

Work this week was more trying than last week. Remote working has settled in and I've been involved with a number of future preperation initiatives. I don't think that my reports understand sometimes, I'm trying to be as transparent and vulnerable as possibile within reason...

Thanks beer!

We're in for a musical night, I'm warming up with some old [Bone Thugs N Harmony - Eternal](https://open.spotify.com/track/14Klge4yTyUeFEn9yvBUjh?si=-00PQEaoQuqB6SQn7Hqdrg), this track is the inspiration for tonights post.

Will see how the flatmates "Coachelle" (lol) YouTube watch party goes. We have a lit playlist lined up, so I can't wait.

Anyway, stay safe, stay amped, and keep your social distancing ffs!
