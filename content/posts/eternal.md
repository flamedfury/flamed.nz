**Alert Level**: Four

**Day**: 12

Thank heck it's Friday. I'm settling in for the evening with a couple cans of [Behemoth Brewing](https://behemoth-brewing.myshopify.com/discount/BEH25G22PEC?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fall) thank heck that they're classified as an essential service otherwise I'd be severly out of sorts.

It has been a wild week and looking forward to the weekend. I've gotta make sure that I watch Bad Boys 3.

Still suprised at people out on walks don't care about social distancing and would rather walk right through us and the three dogs. Geez.

We're in for a musical night, I'm warming up with some old [Bone Thugs N Harmony - Eternal](https://open.spotify.com/track/14Klge4yTyUeFEn9yvBUjh?si=-00PQEaoQuqB6SQn7Hqdrg), this track is the inspiration for tonights post. After that it looks like we have a great YouTube playlist linedup.

Anyway, stay safe, stay amped, and keep your social distancing ffs!
