**Alert Level**: Four

It's raining. Only managed 2 dog walks today. The first one was quite stressful as we had a number of non dog walkers walking around like it ain't nothing and not making way while the dogs were barking at other dogs walking the other way while we were walking.

Doesn't help calm the mind...

People can be dicks.

Spent the night with the wife and the flatmate listening to top tunes through the ages, backwards. This was nice. I enjoyed it.

I enjoy the simple things in love. I love music...

It's raining. Heavy. Will we be able to hang washing out in the morning?

I'm glad the week of work is over. It was a mentaly physical overload.

Stay safe, stay clean, be kind and don't be stupid.
