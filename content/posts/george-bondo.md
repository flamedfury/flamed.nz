**Alert Level**: Four
**Day**: 23

Listend to the album a few times now. [George Bondo is my favourite track](https://open.spotify.com/track/44NwjH8iMskEqgvpkbDfzT?si=dBBcNmtwSlSaXZKEQeRnmQ). A Griselda posse cut will always sit well with me.

Not much happening Covid-19 wise. A few more confirmed cases, no new deaths. Had an issue free supermarket visit this morning, was too early for cooked chickens though.

My [local comic book shop](https://www.comicshoplocator.com/) reached out and they're getting ready for Alert Level 3 so I'm getting myself ready to support them! I guess everyone's relying on Diamond to start functioning again.

Stay safe, don't be stupid!
