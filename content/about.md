title: All About fLaMEd!
---

Hey, Iâ€™m fLaMEd :wave:, I have been a citizen of the Internet since 1996. I love the Internet, but not all things about the Internet. 

I have a huge dislike for the current commercialisation and walled garden silo approach of the modern Internet. 

- [Read about why I have a website](../why-i-have-a-website/). 
- [Find out about my website here](../about-this-website/).

I've got big plans for turning this website into a personal website rather than a chronological list of posts.

## Stuff I Like

The following section breifly details things I like and enjoy.

## Fitness ðŸ’ª

I've been training at a gym in one form or another consistantly over the last decade.

I enjoy a mix of both weights, metcons and high intensity cardio training. I am always mixing it up to keep it interesting.

I feel out of sorts if I don't get some form of exercise through out my day.

## Reading :book:

I've always been a big reader, mostly fiction, sci-fi, fantasy. 

### Books :books:
My favourite authors of all time based on the sheer number of books that I've read by them in no particular order are:
- [Raymond E. Feist](http://crydee.com/).
- [Peter F. Hamilton](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/peter-f-hamilton/0ec100b2-d88d-4ef0-e232-08d5dcda7e06).
- [James S.A. Corey](https://www.jamessacorey.com/).
- [George R.R. Martin](https://georgerrmartin.com/).
- [Russel Meek](https://www.thekhaladastone.com/).

I'm also partial to reading non fiction books too, usually biographies, self written books about famous people I like.

### Comics :scroll:
I enjoy reading comic books. I am a big Marvel fan, and the X-Men are my favourite team, has been since the 90's when I first started getting into them. 

I read comics almost exclusively on [Marvel Unlimited](https://www.marvel.com/comics/unlimited) but I also enjoy collecting single issues. I have a stack of Uncanny X-Men and X-Factor from the late 80s early 90s that I inherited from an uncle and I am slowly filling in the gaps. I am currently collecting the House of X / Powers of X / Dawn of X run that is being published at the moment. Check out [my comics page](/tags/comics/).

I have a stack of Fleer Ultra X-Men cards from the 90s and looking to track down the 2018 set. Might be an expensive exercise as I missed the boat when they were released.

### Articles on the Internet :bookmark_tabs:
I'm forever stuck in multiple browser windows open, each with dozens of tabs at any one time. These are filled with articles that I collect from all over the place and are almost always full of interesting things relating to the web and internet culture. Check out [my bookmarks page](/tags/bookmarks/).

You can check out what I'm currently reading on [my now page](/now/).
